# Hugo Starter Site

This is my favorite way to code static websites. It's a hugo site with the following front-end technologies built in.

**CUBE CSS**

I copied much of the inspiring cube-boilerplate into this Hugo enviroment. I've modified it to use the utopia-core functions for font sizes and spacing.

**Hotwired Turbo**

I use @hotwired/turbo to speed everything up for free.

## Installation

```sh
# Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/jameskerr/hugo-starter
# rename to something you want
mv hugo-starter my-cool-site
# Get in there
cd my-cool-site
# Start the dev server
hugo server
```
